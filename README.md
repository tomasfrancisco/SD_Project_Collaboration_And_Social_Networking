SD_Project_Collaboration_And_Social_Networking
==============================================

Meetings are necessary when several people collaborate and work together. Stu- dents meet to coordinate their work on practical assignments; employees meet to discuss the status of projects; managers meet to make key decisions concerning their organisations; and so on. We need to prevent people from wasting time in useless meetings, because time is one of our most valuable resources. The goal of this assignment is to build a distributed application to improve the effectiveness of meetings. The system shall be able to support the prepara- tion of meetings, writing down the minutes, and following up on the status of action items resulting from a meeting.
